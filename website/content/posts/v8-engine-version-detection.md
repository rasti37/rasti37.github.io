# Introduction

- What you WILL read in this post:

Writing a v8 version detector for Bytenode Compiled JavaScript files (`.jsc`). This required extensive auditing of the v8 engine's codebase, as well as good understanding of some undocumented v8 internals. Its source code can be found in the official GitHub [mirror](https://github.com/v8/v8). I believe that the research process and the problems I dealt with are kinda interesting to include in a post. My ultimate goal is to make a post that I WOULD LOVE to read while I was trying to complete this project.

- What you WON'T read in this post:

Identifying or exploiting any vulnerability in the v8 engine or the `Bytenode` Node.js package.
